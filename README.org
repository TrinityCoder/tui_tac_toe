#+TITLE: TUI-Tac-Toe

Fire it up to join in an unforgettable tic-tac-toe experience in your terminal!

If you downloaded the source code:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run
#+END_SRC

There are some tests! :D

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo test
#+END_SRC

I'll eventually migrate it to make use of tui-rs properly instead of just termion.
When I do it I'll make sure to publish the binaries as well.
